        <h3>Web Design and Development</h3>
        <p>I started to learn web development around 2018 but stopped after the CSS course since I focused on my job. I resigned since 2019 and recalibrated my option then remembered that I am still enrolled in the web design course online. Then I
          have decided to pursue my learning as a web developer during the pandemic. Now I have few projects under my portfolio where you can check. Besides being a web designer I am also practicing some photography and vlogging as a hobby and I
          quite enjoy it.</p>

        <h3>Photography and Vlogging</h3>
        <p>I am also into Photography and vlogging. Most of my photos are posted in my instagram and my vlogs are posted in my youtube and tiktok channel. I have personal vlogs and some comedy contents.</p>
